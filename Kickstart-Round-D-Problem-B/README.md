## multithreaded and singlethreaded codes for [Problem B. Sherlock and The Matrix Game](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/8284487/dashboard#s=p1)

For B-small-practice.in, singlethreaded code runs in 1m34s.102s.<br>
For B-small-practice.in, multithreaded code runs in 0m24.993s.<br>
Ofcourse for large input, these doesn't work. We need to use different algorithm.
